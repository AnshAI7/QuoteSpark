**A premium, mood-aware quote generator app built with Flutter.**

QuoteSpark detects your mood from what you type (in Hindi *and* English), shows you time-relevant quotes throughout the day, and wraps it all in a smooth, animated, glassmorphic UI with 8 customizable card themes.

## 🎯 How Mood Detection Works

QuoteSpark scans your search input against curated keyword lists for each mood — supporting both **English** and **Hindi** (romanized) keywords. For example:

- Typing "khushi" or "happy" → detects **Happy** mood
- Typing "dukh" or "heartbreak" → detects **Sad** mood
- Typing "exam" or "target" → detects **Motivated** mood

This lets users get relevant quotes just by describing how they feel, without manually selecting a filter.
